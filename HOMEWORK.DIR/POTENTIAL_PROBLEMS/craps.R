#These faces contain 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 spots. When the dice have come to 
#rest, the sum of the spots on the two upward faces is calculated.

#(i) If the sum is 7 or 11 on the first throw, the player wins.

#(ii) If the sum is 2, 3, or 12 on the first throw, the play er loses.

#(iii) If the sum is 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10 on the first throw, the sum 
#becomes the playerâ€™s point. To win, you must continue rolling the dice until 
#you make your point. However, the player loses by rolling a 7 before making the point"
